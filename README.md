# AMBA-AXI-PROTOCOL
A verification VIP for SOC-level AXI protocol with comprehensive test cases and functional coverage
# AXI Protocol Verification Project

## Project Overview
The AXI Protocol Verification Project is designed to validate the functionality and performance of the AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) protocol at the System on Chip (SoC) level. This project implements rigorous test cases to ensure compliance with industry standards and to facilitate the reliable operation of AXI transactions.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Test Cases**: Developed and executed test cases for a variety of AXI transaction types, including Incremental, Fixed, and Wrap Transactions.
- **Data Validation**: Created a scoreboard mechanism to validate data transfers, ensuring accuracy and correctness of transaction sequences.
- **Out-of-Order Transaction Support**: Implemented support for out-of-order transactions, allowing for enhanced parallel execution and improved throughput.
- **High Functional Coverage**: Achieved extensive functional coverage of AXI protocol features, including different burst types and error handling mechanisms.

## Requirements
- **Simulation Tools**: Ensure that you have compatible simulation tools such as [ModelSim](https://www.mentor.com/simulation/model-sim/) or [QuestaSim](https://www.mentor.com/simulation/questa/) installed.
- **Languages**: Familiarity with SystemVerilog and Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is recommended for efficient engagement with the test cases.
